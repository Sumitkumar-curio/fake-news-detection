Democratic and Republican lawmakers are working in \\u201cgood faith\\u201d to finalize legislation addressing Puerto Rico\\u2019s debt crisis by May 1, Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said, \\u201cI think we are going to get there.\\u201d Pelosi said at her weekly news conference that Democrats still have some concerns about the bill and are working with Republicans to address them. Republicans who control Congress outlined a plan this week to help Puerto Rico write off billions of dollars in debt if an agreement with creditors is out of reach. That plan would create a forum for investors to negotiate with Puerto Rico officials while the island\\u2019s government tries to curb deficit spending that has created $70 billion in debt.  Ryan told reporters at a separate press conference on Thursday that there were not enough Democratic votes in the House Natural Resources Committee to help get the measure approved. But House Republican aides acknowledge that they also have work to do on their side of the aisle, especially in convincing some of their more conservative members that a Puerto Rico aid bill is needed. Underscoring that, Ryan is calling together his 246 Republican members for a closed meeting on Friday to review the legislation that is taking shape and to urge support. One aide characterized the message Friday as being aimed at helping Republicans understand that if they do not support a Puerto Rico bill now, much more costly bailout measures likely would be necessary down the road. Ryan said his priority on Puerto Rico is twofold: \\u201cTo protect the American taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall Puerto Rico if the status quo continues going in the direction its going.\\u201d Pelosi said Democrats\\u2019 main concern with the Republicans\\u2019 first draft of the legislation was the part of the bill on restructuring. Negotiators were moving forward on the makeup of a proposed oversight board, Pelosi said, but a \\u201cnew wrinkle\\u201d has emerged over the role of creditors in the U.S. commonwealth\\u2019s debt restructuring decisions. Ryan said an oversight board would be the best possible way to prevent taxpayers from bailing out Puerto Rico. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that FBI employees who mishandled classified material in the way Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.   Comey addressed the issue at a House of Representatives committee hearing that lasted nearly five hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that Clinton should be denied classified briefings during her campaign for the presidency. Comey, who said on Tuesday he would not recommend that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee face criminal charges, was asked at the hearing if Clinton should face administrative punishment for the way she handled her email. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s for me to recommend,\\u201d he said. Comey did say his employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation would face discipline for the same behavior. \\u201cThey might get fired, they might lose their clearance, it might get suspended for 30 days,\\u201d Comey said. \\u201cThere would be some discipline.\\u201d Presidential candidates normally get access to classified information once they are formally nominated. As director of the FBI, Comey does not have the authority to revoke Clinton\\u2019s security privileges. A group of Republican senators on Thursday asked the State Department to immediately suspend clearances for Clinton and several current and former aides based on the agency\\u2019s findings.  The State Department said on Thursday it would conduct an internal review of Clinton\\u2019s handling of the emails now that the FBI investigation was over. The department said in April it had suspended plans for a review at the FBI\\u2019s request. \\u201cI cannot provide specific information about the Department\\u2019s review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process,\\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. A Clinton spokesman on Thursday criticized the congressional hearing for its \\u201cpartisan motivations,\\u201d and expressed confidence that Comey\\u2019s testimony had shut down any lingering \\u201cconspiracy theories\\u201d on the matter.  \\u201cDirector Comey\\u2019s testimony clearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clinton\\u2019s public statements,\\u201d spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.  The issue of Clinton\\u2019s use of private email servers has cast a cloud over her campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election, raising questions among voters about her trustworthiness and judgment and giving her Republican presidential rival, Donald Trump, an avenue of attack. Comey\\u2019s testimony marked the first time he took questions publicly since his announcement the FBI was not recommending charges against Clinton. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accepted the FBI recommendation and was to appear at another hearing next Tuesday.  Comey had disappointed some Republicans by only rebuking Clinton, not recommending charges against her, for what he called her \\u201cextremely careless\\u201d handling of classified information while using private email servers.  Under persistent questioning at the hearing of the House Oversight Committee, Comey said Clinton did not break the law. \\u201cThe question I always look at is, is there evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody engaged in conduct that violated a criminal statute. And my judgment here is there is not,\\u201d Comey said.    Comey also said Clinton knew her email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, was not authorized to receive classified information. But Clinton may not have had sufficiently sophisticated understanding to know the emails that passed through her personal server were classified, Comey said. Only three of the FBI-reviewed emails were explicitly marked as classified and those were marked with a \\u201cC\\u201d in the body of the email, not in the header, he said. Comey said his FBI team conducted its investigation of Clinton \\u201cin an apolitical and professional way\\u201d and he had no reason to believe she had lied to the FBI. Clinton had said publicly she never sent or received any classified information. \\u201cI think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double standard, if your name isn\\u2019t Clinton or you are not part of the powerful elite that Lady Justice will act differently,\\u201d U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said to Comey at the beginning of the hearing. A Democratic member of the committee, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, defended Comey\\u2019s actions by saying: \\u201cI firmly believe your decision was based on conviction, not convenience.\\u201d Comey, a Republican who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and also served in the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush, has built a reputation as a straight shooter who does not bend to pressure from either party. He has differed sharply with the Obama administration, including over the case of General David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty after he knowingly shared classified information with his biographer and lover. Comey recommended Petraeus be charged with a felony, but then-Attorney General Eric Holder downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor. The hearing took place as Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get them behind his candidacy, discussing a variety of issues, including his campaign style. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to make you proud,\\u201d Trump told House Republicans, according to a participant, Representative Bill Flores. \",\n          \"Liberal California Governor Jerry Brown just signed the Motor Voter Act allowing non-citizens to be registered to vote. Is this coming to your state soon?Non-Citizens Will Now Vote In At Least One StateGovernor Jerry Brown just sold out the American vote in California. He signed a new version of the Motor Voter Act that will register every eligible California citizen who acquires a driver s license or renews a license at the Department of Motor Vehicles to vote.This is after he made all illegal aliens eligible for diver s licenses. Eleven states allow illegal aliens to get driver s licenses.In California, state officials  specifically chose not to make noncitizen license holders searchable in their DMV database,  said True the Vote spokesman Logan Churchwell, who called the newly signed bill  unprecedented. The measure, Assembly Bill 1461,  will effectively change the form of governance in California from a Republic whose elected officials are determined by United States citizens and will guarantee that noncitizens will participate in all California elections going forward,  Election Integrity Project of California President Linda Paine said in a statement.It appears to be unconstitutional.This is what conservatives were afraid of and this is just one more example of a conspiracy theory come true. It will undoubtedly ramp up voter fraud in California.California s Secretary of State feels differently In a free society, the right to vote is fundamental,  said Secretary of State Alex Padilla.  The New Motor Voter Act will make our democracy stronger by removing a key barrier to voting for millions of California citizens.

Democratic and Republican lawmakers are working in \\u201cgood faith\\u201d to finalize legislation addressing Puerto Rico\\u2019s debt crisis by May 1, Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said, \\u201cI think we are going to get there.\\u201d Pelosi said at her weekly news conference that Democrats still have some concerns about the bill and are working with Republicans to address them. Republicans who control Congress outlined a plan this week to help Puerto Rico write off billions of dollars in debt if an agreement with creditors is out of reach. That plan would create a forum for investors to negotiate with Puerto Rico officials while the island\\u2019s government tries to curb deficit spending that has created $70 billion in debt.  Ryan told reporters at a separate press conference on Thursday that there were not enough Democratic votes in the House Natural Resources Committee to help get the measure approved. But House Republican aides acknowledge that they also have work to do on their side of the aisle, especially in convincing some of their more conservative members that a Puerto Rico aid bill is needed. Underscoring that, Ryan is calling together his 246 Republican members for a closed meeting on Friday to review the legislation that is taking shape and to urge support. One aide characterized the message Friday as being aimed at helping Republicans understand that if they do not support a Puerto Rico bill now, much more costly bailout measures likely would be necessary down the road. Ryan said his priority on Puerto Rico is twofold: \\u201cTo protect the American taxpayer and to help bring order to the chaos that will befall Puerto Rico if the status quo continues going in the direction its going.\\u201d Pelosi said Democrats\\u2019 main concern with the Republicans\\u2019 first draft of the legislation was the part of the bill on restructuring. Negotiators were moving forward on the makeup of a proposed oversight board, Pelosi said, but a \\u201cnew wrinkle\\u201d has emerged over the role of creditors in the U.S. commonwealth\\u2019s debt restructuring decisions. Ryan said an oversight board would be the best possible way to prevent taxpayers from bailing out Puerto Rico. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that FBI employees who mishandled classified material in the way Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.   Comey addressed the issue at a House of Representatives committee hearing that lasted nearly five hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that Clinton should be denied classified briefings during her campaign for the presidency. Comey, who said on Tuesday he would not recommend that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee face criminal charges, was asked at the hearing if Clinton should face administrative punishment for the way she handled her email. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s for me to recommend,\\u201d he said. Comey did say his employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation would face discipline for the same behavior. \\u201cThey might get fired, they might lose their clearance, it might get suspended for 30 days,\\u201d Comey said. \\u201cThere would be some discipline.\\u201d Presidential candidates normally get access to classified information once they are formally nominated. As director of the FBI, Comey does not have the authority to revoke Clinton\\u2019s security privileges. A group of Republican senators on Thursday asked the State Department to immediately suspend clearances for Clinton and several current and former aides based on the agency\\u2019s findings.  The State Department said on Thursday it would conduct an internal review of Clinton\\u2019s handling of the emails now that the FBI investigation was over. The department said in April it had suspended plans for a review at the FBI\\u2019s request. \\u201cI cannot provide specific information about the Department\\u2019s review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process,\\u201d State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. A Clinton spokesman on Thursday criticized the congressional hearing for its \\u201cpartisan motivations,\\u201d and expressed confidence that Comey\\u2019s testimony had shut down any lingering \\u201cconspiracy theories\\u201d on the matter.  \\u201cDirector Comey\\u2019s testimony clearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clinton\\u2019s public statements,\\u201d spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.  The issue of Clinton\\u2019s use of private email servers has cast a cloud over her campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election, raising questions among voters about her trustworthiness and judgment and giving her Republican presidential rival, Donald Trump, an avenue of attack. Comey\\u2019s testimony marked the first time he took questions publicly since his announcement the FBI was not recommending charges against Clinton. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accepted the FBI recommendation and was to appear at another hearing next Tuesday.  Comey had disappointed some Republicans by only rebuking Clinton, not recommending charges against her, for what he called her \\u201cextremely careless\\u201d handling of classified information while using private email servers.  Under persistent questioning at the hearing of the House Oversight Committee, Comey said Clinton did not break the law. \\u201cThe question I always look at is, is there evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody engaged in conduct that violated a criminal statute. And my judgment here is there is not,\\u201d Comey said.    Comey also said Clinton knew her email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, was not authorized to receive classified information. But Clinton may not have had sufficiently sophisticated understanding to know the emails that passed through her personal server were classified, Comey said. Only three of the FBI-reviewed emails were explicitly marked as classified and those were marked with a \\u201cC\\u201d in the body of the email, not in the header, he said. Comey said his FBI team conducted its investigation of Clinton \\u201cin an apolitical and professional way\\u201d and he had no reason to believe she had lied to the FBI. Clinton had said publicly she never sent or received any classified information. \\u201cI think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double standard, if your name isn\\u2019t Clinton or you are not part of the powerful elite that Lady Justice will act differently,\\u201d U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said to Comey at the beginning of the hearing. A Democratic member of the committee, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, defended Comey\\u2019s actions by saying: \\u201cI firmly believe your decision was based on conviction, not convenience.\\u201d Comey, a Republican who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and also served in the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush, has built a reputation as a straight shooter who does not bend to pressure from either party. He has differed sharply with the Obama administration, including over the case of General David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty after he knowingly shared classified information with his biographer and lover. Comey recommended Petraeus be charged with a felony, but then-Attorney General Eric Holder downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor. The hearing took place as Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get them behind his candidacy, discussing a variety of issues, including his campaign style. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to make you proud,\\u201d Trump told House Republicans, according to a participant, Representative Bill Flores. \",\n          \"Liberal California Governor Jerry Brown just signed the Motor Voter Act allowing non-citizens to be registered to vote. Is this coming to your state soon?Non-Citizens Will Now Vote In At Least One StateGovernor Jerry Brown just sold out the American vote in California. He signed a new version of the Motor Voter Act that will register every eligible California citizen who acquires a driver s license or renews a license at the Department of Motor Vehicles to vote.This is after he made all illegal aliens eligible for diver s licenses. Eleven states allow illegal aliens to get driver s licenses.In California, state officials  specifically chose not to make noncitizen license holders searchable in their DMV database,  said True the Vote spokesman Logan Churchwell, who called the newly signed bill  unprecedented. The measure, Assembly Bill 1461,  will effectively change the form of governance in California from a Republic whose elected officials are determined by United States citizens and will guarantee that noncitizens will participate in all California elections going forward,  Election Integrity Project of California President Linda Paine said in a statement.It appears to be unconstitutional.This is what conservatives were afraid of and this is just one more example of a conspiracy theory come true. It will undoubtedly ramp up voter fraud in California.California s Secretary of State feels differently In a free society, the right to vote is fundamental,  said Secretary of State Alex Padilla.  The New Motor Voter Act will make our democracy stronger by removing a key barrier to voting for millions of California citizens.
